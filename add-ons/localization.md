# Localization

## Platform Localization Add-On

This Add-On allows you to translate your IoT app, console and all of the transactional emails to additional languages. Anything can be localized - from system messages to widget and datastream names.

{% hint style="info" %}
One language per add-on, multiple add-ons possible.
{% endhint %}

The process is the following:&#x20;

1. We share with you a file containing all of the texts present in your mobile app, Console and transactional emails&#x20;
2. You provide us with a copy translated into your language of choice&#x20;
3. Your Blynk launch engineer implements the translations&#x20;
4. The language is than adjusted based on your userâ€™s phone settings, if the corresponding translation is available.

{% hint style="info" %}
The add-on is available to Business plan subscribers only. Contact your launch engineer to unlock and set up.
{% endhint %}
