## In-app Tracking

The feature gives you better understanding of how customers are using your products and the app. Blynk apps are tracking click/tap events and send results to Firebase.&#x20;

_Typical use case: track how often customers use a certain feature or track most common user journeys._

{% hint style="success" %}
All collected data is anonymized. There is no way to track actions of a particular user.
{% endhint %}

In Firebase you can build custom reports, or ask Blynk team to set them up for you.

**To enable in-app tracking and set up the add-on contact your launch engineer.**&#x20;

There are two types of events: events tracked by default and events related to your device dashboard (widgets).

Here is what can be tracked:

#### Default Mobile App Events
