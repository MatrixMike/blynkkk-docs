# Database Access

## Direct Access to the Database Add-On

This Add-on allows you to create a read-only version of your Blynk database that can be further used to safely integrate your IoT data into any 3rd party data analytics services you may be already using for your business.&#x20;

Our clients typically use this to set up integrations with tools like PowerBI or Tableau, but it can be any service that supports Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).

{% hint style="info" %}
The add-on is available to Business plan subscribers only. Contact your launch engineer to unlock and set up.
