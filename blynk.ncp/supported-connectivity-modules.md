# Supported Connectivity Modules

To enable a seamless connection and advanced Blynk’s functionality using the hardware of your choice, you need to add one of the supported connectivity modules below as a Network Co-Processor. We’ve prepared an [example](https://github.com/blynkkk/BlynkNcpExample/blob/main/docs/BuildYourOwn.md) that includes firmware and will help you set up the communication between your hardware and Blynk with minimal effort.

Blynk.NCP is shipped as a combined firmware, so you only need to flash a single file (flash at address `0`). Select the firmware file, corresponding to your module type.
