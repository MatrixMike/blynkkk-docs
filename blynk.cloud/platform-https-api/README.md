# Platform API

The Platform API provides comprehensive access to all features of the Blynk IoT Platform through a secure HTTPS API. It enables you to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a wide range of entities. These entities include devices, users, organizations, automations, webhooks, tags, templates, and more, giving you extensive control and flexibility.
