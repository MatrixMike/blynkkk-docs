# Transfer Device

## Transfer Device

<mark style="color:green;">`POST`</mark> `https://{server_address}/api/v1/organization/device/transfer`

To successfully trasnfer device, you need to fulfil these requirements:



**Choose Either User or Organization ID**

Specify one of two identifiers â€“ either `newUserId` or `newOrgId`. Note that if you provide `newUserId`, the system will ignore `newOrgId`, and the other way around.



**Access to Destination Organization:**

You must have access rights to the organization to which you're transferring the device. If you don't specify an organization, the system will default to using the organization of the new owner.



**Activation of New Owner's Account:** The account of the new device owner must be activated for the transfer to be successful.
