# What's Needed To Publish Your Apps And Go Live



### Domain name and server location <a href="#server-name-and-location" id="server-name-and-location"></a>

By default, your business server will be launched at `https://mycompanyname.blynk.cc` in the region of your choice.

Your devices will connect to this server.&#x20;

Your customers will be using this address to log in to Console, but this address can be custom, for example: `https://dashboard.mycompanyname.com`





### Website URL <a href="#website" id="website"></a>

If you plan to publish your apps to Google Play and App Store you would need a legit website for your company. This is are requirement from both Apple and Google. If you don't have a website you would need to build at least a simple landing page.





### Terms and Conditions and  Privacy Policy Links <a href="#public-link-to-your-privacy-policy" id="public-link-to-your-privacy-policy"></a>

Google and Apple require a public link to your Privacy Policy which means that you need to add a privacy policy as a separate page to your own website. There is a handful of resources on the web on privacy policy examples for different countries.

You can't go live without these links. Blynk can't provide you with these links as they are company and region specific.&#x20;
