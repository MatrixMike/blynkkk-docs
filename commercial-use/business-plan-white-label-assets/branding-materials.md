# Branding Materials

### App Name <a href="#app-name" id="app-name"></a>

### App Icons <a href="#icon" id="icon"></a>

Your app icon design is very important. Please follow [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/app-icon/) and [Google](https://developer.android.com/distribute/google-play/resources/icon-design-specifications) guidelines to design nice looking and recognizable icons.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Corner rounding is not allowed.** You need to provide images with no corner raiduses applied. Rounding is applied by an operating system of the smartphone. Different OS apply different rounding. So make sure that your icon content is not cropped with any radius
{% endhint %}
