In-App notifications



### In-app Tracking

Better understand how customers are using your products and app. Blynk apps are tracking click tap events and send results to Firebase. Then your can create build custom reports, or ask Blynk team to set it up for you.

Example: track how often customers use a certain feature or track most common user journeys

There are two types of events: events tracked by default and events related to your device dashboard (widgets).

All collected data is anonymized. There is no way to track actions of a particular user.



Contact your launch engineer to enable this feature and set it up.&#x20;



Here is what can be tracked:
