### Intro <a id="intro"></a>

This article will help you with the creation of your Preview Application and will tell you the main points that you should pay attention to.  
To create an Preview Application you need to have at least one project that will be used in this Preview Aplication.

After creating a project, you need to open the last window in the list of your projects and click "My Apps":

**App Name**  
Any application must have a name. In this [article](https://app.intercom.io/a/apps/hhaxrs9k/articles/articles/2692182/show), you can find small recommendations on the choice of names for applications.

  
**App Icon**  
We provide a small test set of icons for your application. Preview Application will allow you to see this icon on the start page:

By activating [Blynk.Faces](https://app.intercom.io/a/apps/hhaxrs9k/articles/articles/802275/show), you can select several projects at once that will be used in your Preview Application.  
You can add new projects, but you can not remove them from the Preview Application.

### Provisioning <a id="provisioning"></a>
