### Use Blynk with Node.js <a href="#use-blynk-with-nodejs" id="use-blynk-with-nodejs"></a>

Node.js is easy to write scripts, update, and prototype. It also supports secure SSL connection out-of-the-box.

Node.js has lots of modules for Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, Desktop Ubuntu etc - which makes integration very easy.

Node.js has timers, asynchronous operations, etc - this is important when you start building more complex applications.

### Use Blynk with C++  <a href="#use-blynk-with-c" id="use-blynk-with-c"></a>

If you want just to toggle a pin, it will simply work out-of-the-box.\
But if you want to add more functionality, it **will** require some Linux, threading, sockets knowledge, modifying Makefile, etc.\
So, C++ is generally **for advanced developers**.
