#### **Bare-minimum sketch** <a href="bare-minimum-sketch" id="bare-minimum-sketch"></a>

If an issue is in your code and it is not reproducible with the Sketch Template please send us a bare-minimum sketch. It allows you to reproduce the issue and does not contain unnecessary logic because we will not be able to review all your lines of code.

#### **Other** <a href="other" id="other"></a>

If your issue is with:\
1\. UI / UX: we will need a screenshot with the issue

2\. Communication with a server: we will need your application logs\
3\. Sending data between board-server-application: we will need your application logs / Serial Monitor Output / bare-minimum sketch\
4\. If a screenshot will not display the issue because it is not static or it is difficult to describe it with the text - we will need a video.\
