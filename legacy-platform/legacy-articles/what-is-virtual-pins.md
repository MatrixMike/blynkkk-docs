# What is Virtual Pins

**Virtual Pin** is a concept invented by Blynk Inc. to provide exchange of any data between hardware and Blynk mobile app.&#x20;

Virtual pins are different than  [Digital](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPins) and [Analog](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInputPins) Input/Output (I/O) pins. They are **physical pins** on your microcontroller board where you connect sensors and actuators.![](https://uploads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/19844964/1b2212d3c5c061943f6bdeb0/Group+5.png)

**Blynk lets you control any hardware connected to Digital and Analog pins without having to write any additional code.**

For example, if you need to turn On/Off LED connected to Digital pin, you don't have to write any code:&#x20;

1. Just use [BlynkBlink code for your hardware](http://examples.blynk.cc).&#x20;
2. In the Blynk app - add **Button Widget** and set it to pin **D8**
3. That's it! No additional code is required. Simply press Play in the app.

That was, easy, right? But what if you need more flexibility?

### Virtual Pins <a href="#virtual-pins" id="virtual-pins"></a>

Virtual pins allow you to interface with any sensor, any library, any actuator.&#x20;

Imagine that there are "virtual" pins that you can use\

Think about Virtual Pins as a box where you can put any value, and everyone who has access to this box can see this value.

It's a very powerful feature to **display and send any data** from your hardware to Blynk app.&#x20;

**‚òùÔ∏è Remember, that virtual pins have no physical properties.**

There are two fundamental commands you need to know to use Virtual Pins:

### To read data from Blynk app widgets <a href="#to-read-data-from-blynk-app-widgets" id="to-read-data-from-blynk-app-widgets"></a>

Use this block of code:

```
BLYNK_WRITE(V5) // V5 is the number of Virtual Pin  
{
  int pinValue = param.asInt();
}
```

Where `param.asInt()`  is the value from V5.

### To send data from your hardware to Blynk app <a href="#to-send-data-from-your-hardware-to-blynk-app" id="to-send-data-from-your-hardware-to-blynk-app"></a>

Use this command `Blynk.virtualWrite(V5)` where V5 is the Virtual Pin you are using. &#x20;

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:**\
**Don't place** `Blynk.virtualWrite(V5)` **inside**  `void loop()`&#x20;
