  hardware?

# How to find code for my hardware?

{% hint style="warning" %}
This documentation is for the LEGACY version of Blynk platform which is no longer supported and will be shut down.&#x20;

You can sign up for the current version of Blynk platform [here](http://blynk.cloud/register).

The new mobile apps can be downloaded from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blynk-iot/id1559317868) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cloud.blynk\&hl=en\&gl=US).

The actual Blynk documentation is [here](https://docs.blynk.io/).
{% endhint %}

Blynk works with hundreds of hardware models and connection types. We prepared **Blynk Examples Sketch Builder** that allows you to create example code for your hardware.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Find a full list of all supported hardware [here](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynkkk.github.io/blob/master/SupportedHardware.md) <a href="#find-a-full-list-of-all-supported-hardware-here" id="find-a-full-list-of-all-supported-hardware-here"></a>

‚òùÔ∏è **Before moving forward, make sure you have Blynk Library properly installed.**\


### Find the example code for your hardware <a href="#find-the-example-code-for-your-hardware" id="find-the-example-code-for-your-hardware"></a>

[Open Blynk Examples Builder](http://examples.blynk.cc/)![](https://uploads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/19400959/c0c34377e80478a4a02354ca/examples2.gif)

1. Choose your board
2. Choose your Connection (WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, USB...)
3. Browse through examples and choose the one you need
4. Sketch Builder will create a sketch for you.
5. Copy the whole code and paste it to Arduino IDE

### Input your Auth Token <a href="#input-your-auth-token" id="input-your-auth-token"></a>

In the example sketch find the line:

```
char auth[] = "YourAuthToken";
```

Change it with your own Auth Token (it should be in your email inbox after you created the Project in the Blynk app.

Now this line should look similar to this:

```
char auth[] = "53e4da8793764b6197fc44a673ce4e21";
```

üî• Flash the example code to your hardware

### Done! Now go and try other examples: <a href="#done-now-go-and-try-other-examples" id="done-now-go-and-try-other-examples"></a>
