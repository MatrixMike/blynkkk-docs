# Raspberry Pi and Blynk

{% hint style="warning" %}
This documentation is for the LEGACY version of Blynk platform which is no longer supported and will be shut down.&#x20;

You can sign up for the current version of Blynk platform [here](http://blynk.cloud/dashboard/register).

The new mobile apps can be downloaded from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blynk-iot/id1559317868) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cloud.blynk\&hl=en\&gl=US).

The actual Blynk documentation is [here](https://docs.blynk.io/).
{% endhint %}

Blynk works with any model of Raspberry Pi **over WiFi / Ethernet**.&#x20;

**☝️We don't support BLE of Raspberry Pi 3 (yet)**

When writing apps on RPi, you can use Node.JS or C++.
