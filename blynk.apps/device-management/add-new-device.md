### **iOS device connection:**

Once the **Ready** button is hit, the application tries to automatically connect to the device AP based on its hotspot prefix - **Blynk**. If connection is successful, the app goes straight to the **Connect your device** step. If unsuccessful (e.g. because the device has different hotspot prefix), the app presents with the instructions to go to the system settings and connect to the device manually:

* tap **Go to Settings;**
* select your Device in Wi-Fi settings
* return back to the Blynk application
* tap **Already connected;**
* if asked, **allow** Blynk application to connect to devices in your local network;
* proceed with common add device **flow**
