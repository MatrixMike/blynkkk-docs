# Device header constructor

The header constructor allows you to customize the header of your device according to your preferences. You can add important labels such as Connection Status and Last Reported timestamp, display an image inside the device's header, or assign Standalone Pages to the Header Buttons. You can also experiment with colors to make it more visually appealing.
