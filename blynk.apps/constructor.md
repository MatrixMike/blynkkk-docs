# Mobile Dashboard Editor

The primary function of Developer Mode in the mobile app is to build and edit the Mobile Dashboard User interface (GUI) for the given Device Template.

Mobile Dashboard is built from Widgets - modular UI elements which can be positioned on the canvas. Every Widget serves a special function (a button, a slider, a chart, etc). Every Widget has it's own settings based on its functionality

### **How to enable Developer Mode**

1. In the Blynk.Apps or in Blynk.Console
2. Navigate to **My Profile** / **User profile** in the left menu
3. Check that **Developer Mode** switch is set to ON

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, **only one developer is allowed per Organization** to avoid sync issues. This limit can be changed later.
{% endhint %}

## How To Edit Mobile Dashboard

If you don't have any Device Templates, you can create a basic template in the app and then fully set it up in Blynk.Console later.

When there is a Device Template already, you can tap on it and start working with mobile dashboard layout.
