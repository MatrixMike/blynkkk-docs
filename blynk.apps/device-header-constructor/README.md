# Device Header Constructor

The header constructor allows you to customize the header of your device dashboard according to your preferences.&#x20;

You can add important labels such as Connection Status and Last Reported timestamp, display an image inside the device's header, or assign Standalone Pages to the Header Buttons.&#x20;

You can also experiment with colors to make it more visually appealing.&#x20;
