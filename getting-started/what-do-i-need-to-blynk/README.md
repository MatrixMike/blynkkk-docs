### To get started:

1. Create a Blynk account using [Blynk.Console](https://docs.blynk.io/en/blynk.console/console-overview) or [Blynk.App for iOS or Android](../../downloads/blynk-apps-for-ios-and-android.md).
2. Switch to [Developer Mode](../developer-mode.md) in Blynk.Console or Blynk.App
3. Have a supported hardware (ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc). The list of supported devices is [here](../../blynk.edgent-firmware-api/supported-boards.md).
4. Be familiar with  the basics of electric circuitry and know how to at least blink an LED using Arduino boards, know how to install libraries, etc.

When your device gets online,  learn how it was setup:
