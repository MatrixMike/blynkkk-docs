# Quickstart

We've prepared a quick and easy way to connect your first device. Whether you are using Blynk.Console or Blynk.Apps, on your first login, it will start automatically. We highly recommend to follow these guides to get the first results and move forward.

### To get started:

1. Create a Blynk account using [Blynk.Console](https://docs.blynk.io/en/blynk.console/console-overview) or [Blynk.App for iOS or Android](../../downloads/blynk-apps-for-ios-and-android.md).
2. Have a supported hardware \(ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc\). The list of supported devices is [here](../../blynk.edgent/supported-boards.md).
3. Be familiar with  the basics of electric circuitry and know how to at least blink an LED using Arduino boards, know how to install libraries, etc.

When your device gets online,  learn how it was setup:
