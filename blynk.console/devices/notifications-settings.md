# Notifications Settings

Blynk offers a very flexible way to send notifications. Users can specify who gets notifications, which events will trigger notifications, and which channel should be used.

Currently, Blynk offers 3 channels to deliver notifications:

* E-mail
* Push notifications - a push notification is a message that pops up on a mobile device. Users don't have to be in the app to get them
* SMS - notification will be delivered as a text message using mobile operator

### Muting notifications

Notifications can be muted for a specified period of time. Click on the switch near the Event status and you will get a dropdown menu with the mute period options.

Notifications will be automatically unmuted after the specified period.

_❇️ This feature is useful when you need to temporarily mute notifications. For example during deployment, testing, or maintenance at job site._
