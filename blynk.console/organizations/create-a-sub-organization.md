# Create a Sub-Organization

The workflow is to log in to Blynk, create the sub-organization(s), assign templates, assign an ‘Admin’ member, transfer or create users, and finally create or transfer devices (assign a user to the device).  Members with the correct roles and permissions can also create and provision devices.

Login to Blynk as a user with a role and permissions that will allow you to create/edit an organization, add/edit templates, edit devices, and transfer users. The ‘Admin’ role with default permissions is sufficient.

From the Blynk.Console sidebar, click on the ‘Organizations’ icon, and then the ‘+ Create New Organization’ button.

Under the ‘Info’ tab, assign a ‘NAME’, and optionally a ‘DESCRIPTION’ and logo.  Logo image must be between 500x500px and 4096x2048 pixels. &#x20;

Click on the ‘Templates’ tab, and then click on one or more templates to be enabled for the sub-organization. Enabling a template will permit devices to be later transferred to designated users in that sub-organization.

Click on the ‘Users’ tab to add members who will have access to the devices and data associated with the templates selected.

You can dynamically invite users that currently don’t have a Blynk account and assign them the [roles](https://docs.blynk.io/en/blynk.console/settings/access#roles-and-permissions) of ‘Admin’, ‘Staff’, or ‘User’ on this tab as well.  See ‘[How to Assign a Device to a User](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y\_PpM8KAuvTYCgAaOjuDmh5oL637Vq4Dcuel07LGCkM/edit?pli=1#bookmark=id.je16rq9h3eu)’ for more details.

Existing Blynk members will need to be transferred.

Click the ‘Create’ button when finished.  Repeat the process to create any other sub-organizations. &#x20;

Once a sub-organization is created, you may transfer devices to the sub-organization by [assigning a user to a device](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y\_PpM8KAuvTYCgAaOjuDmh5oL637Vq4Dcuel07LGCkM/edit?pli=1#bookmark=id.je16rq9h3eu).  You may also create new devices and then [assign a user to the device](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y\_PpM8KAuvTYCgAaOjuDmh5oL637Vq4Dcuel07LGCkM/edit?pli=1#bookmark=id.je16rq9h3eu), or the user may [provision the device](https://docs.blynk.io/en/commercial-use/deploying-products-with-dynamic-authtokens#delivering-products-to-clients-pro-plan-workflow).
