# Browse & Edit a Sub-Organization

Login to Blynk as a user with a role and permissions that will allow you to perform your intended actions.  The ‘Admin’ role with default permissions is sufficient.

Click on the sidebar ‘Organizations’ and a list of your organizations will appear.  Click on a particular organization and then the details are displayed in the tabs ‘Info’, ‘Templates’, ‘Users’, ‘Locations’.   Note that only the first level of organizations are displayed.  Navigate to ‘Search -> ‘ORGANIZATIONS’ to switch to a sub-organization, enabling you to then see any third level or deeper sub-organizations.

### Add Templates to a Sub-Organization

Under the ‘Templates’ tab, you will only see the templates that have been enabled for your organization.  In order to see what other templates are available to be enabled, click the ‘Edit’ button at the upper right of the Blynk.Console.  After a template has been enabled for your sub-organization, the related devices may be [transferred](https://docs.blynk.io/en/blynk.console/devices/actions-with-devices#move-device-to-another-organization-within-your-hierarchy) to another user.  Enabling a template for a sub-organization doesn’t perform any automatic device transfers, but it does allow devices to be transferred.&#x20;

### Invite Users to a Sub-Organization

From the ‘Users’ tab, you may invite new users to add them to the organization, and you can delete users.

The ‘Locations’ tab doesn’t currently display any assigned organizations.  Navigate to ‘Settings -> ORGANIZATION SETTINGS -> Locations’, or ‘Search -> LOCATIONS’ to see them, add new locations, assign users, and delete locations. &#x20;

You may also browse organizations from ‘Search -> [ORGANIZATIONS’](https://docs.blynk.io/en/blynk.console/search-data).  It provides a useful way to see device and user assignment to organizations. &#x20;

### Switch to a Sub-Organization

You can make a particular sub-organization active from Search -> ORGANIZATIONS and then under the list, hover your mouse over the organization name and click on the ‘Switch to’ link. On doing that you will view the sub-organization exactly like the users of this sub-organization would, which will make troubleshooting far easier.

Once you switch to a sub-organization, you will see the templates, devices, and users assigned to the sub-organization.  The scope of devices each sub-organization user will see depends on their [device permissions](https://docs.blynk.io/en/blynk.console/settings/access#devices).

You can navigate back to your root organization by clicking the Blynk logo at the top of the sidebar menu (top left corner).
