# Switch

_**Note:**_ please remember that web and apps widgets are set up separately and may have same datastreams set to view the same data (excepts Map widgets – those two use different codebase now).

Switch widget allows to send commands and view binary statuses of the device, such as power ON/OFF

* Name the Switch widget by editing **Switch** inside top field;\

* **Target** – access available Datastreams dropdown list by click on _**Choose Source**_;\

* set **ON/OFF Values** in the corresponding fields;\

* **Text Alignment** – 2 options here: left and right;\

* **Color** – pick a color for Switch ON status background from palette or define it by color number input;\

* **Show on/off labels** – you can add labels for different Switch statuses: for each of them or both filling **ON Label** and/or **OFF Label**
  * **Label Position** – 2 options here: left and right;\

* the last option: it's possible to **Hide widget name**.
