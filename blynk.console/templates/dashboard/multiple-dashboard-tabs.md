# Multiple Dashboard Tabs

The default dashboard has a single tab named ‘Dashboard’ automatically created. You may add additional tabs to the dashboard by clicking the ‘+’ icon (‘Add Tab’). Tabs allow you to group widgets based on their use case, or whatever grouping fits your project. You may also restrict access to particular tabs based on the three possible user roles of Admin, Staff, Users.

Add additional tabs to the dashboard by clicking the ‘+’ icon (‘Add Tab’):

The default dashboard tab ‘Dashboard’ is visible to all users, and it cannot be deleted. Any added tab can be later deleted, and access to the tab may be restricted based on the user’s role within the root organization, and the sub organization. Click on the user icon in order to edit the tab’s access permissions. The window shown below will appear.
