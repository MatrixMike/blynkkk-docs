# Multiple Dashboard Tabs

Each device can have multiple dashboard tabs in Blynk Console. This feature allows to group widgets based on use cases and set up access permissions to view certain tabs. For example, you can set up a general device tab for all users and a separate one with restricted access for staff use.

To create new tabs in your web dashboard in Blynk.Console:

* Go to Device Template
* Go to Web Dashboard section
* Click on “Add Tab”
* Name the tab
* Add widgets as usual
