# Gauge

_**Note:**_ please remember that web and apps widgets are set up separately and may have same datastreams set to view the same data (excepts Image Gallery Map widgets – those two use different codebase now).

A great visual way to display incoming numeric values, e.g. Temperature, Pressure, Volume, etc..

* **Title** – name the widget by editing _Gauge_ inside top field
* **Datastream** – select the one that will provide it's value
* **Level color**
  * disabled **Change color based on value** – pick a color from palette;
  * enabled **Change color based on value**:
    * set **MIN** and **MAX** values and level color for that values range
    * default set is of 3 options and it can be changed in range from 1 to as much as you need:
      * click **+Add Value** button under the last MIN field to _**increase**_ set;
      * you can **Delete** value range sets anytime you want to.
