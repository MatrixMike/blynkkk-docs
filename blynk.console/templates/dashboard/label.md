# Label

_**Note:**_ please remember that web and apps widgets are set up separately and may have same datastreams set to view the same data (excepts Map widgets – those two use different codebase now).

Label is used to show value of Virtual Pin e.g. length/distance, mass, duration, volume, temperature and other data types including strings.

* **Label** – name a Label widget so you or your client understand what it's about    \

* **Source** – there are two fields:  \

  * **Choose Source** contains _**Datastreams used in the Product**_. Select one;  \

  *   the left is _**Source agregation type menu**_ it's used to select an option to be viewed:  

      **AVG of** will plot average value per minute;  

      **Raw of** data will plot using all the data available;  

      **SUM of** will summarize all incoming values to the specified Virtual Pin;  

      **MIN of** will plot minimum value per minute;  

      **MAX of** will plot maximum value per minute;  

      **COUNT of** will plot the number of times data was sent by device per minute;  \

* **Suffix** – inches, lbs, oz, minutes, °F, etc., that will be shown after the value;\

* **Text Alignment** – 3 options are available: Left, Center, Right;\

* **Background** \

  * disabled **Change color based on value**:
    * **Background** – pick a color for Label widget background from palette or define it by color number input
    * **Text** – same here;\

  * enabled **Change color based on value**:
    * set **MIN** and **MAX** values and Background and Font colors (as it's described in previous paragraph);
    * **Custom Text (optional)** – value can be replaced by any text message up to 200 characters (be sure to set corresponding Label widget size);
    * default set is of 3 options and it can be changed in range from 1 to as much as you need:
      * click **+** button under the last MIN field to _**increase**_ set;
      * hover to the right from CUSTOM TEXT field, _**Delete**_ button will appear;\

* **Level** – enable it by switching **Show level** on to visualize accordingly to values set in **MIN and MAX Value** fields below.
