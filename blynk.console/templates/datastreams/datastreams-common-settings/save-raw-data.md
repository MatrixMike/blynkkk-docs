# Save RAW Data

By default server stores only 1 data point per data stream per minute. In case you sent more than 1 point within 1 minute interval - value for that data stream will be averaged.

Raw data allows you to store every value that hardware sends.

Enabling this option allows to view Datastreams data changes dynamic in [Custom Chart widgets](../../../widgets-console/custom-chart.md).
