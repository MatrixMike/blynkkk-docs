# Notifications Settings

Notifications work on top of Events. Blynk platform offers a flexible way to send notifications to various recipients through supported channels:

* Emails
* Push Notifications to the user's smartphone
* SMS \(additional charges apply\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Only registered Blynk users can be notifications recipients.
{% endhint %}

Notifications are configured in the second tab of Event - &gt; Notifications

Start with Enabling notifications by turning on this option.

### Default recipients

Here you can assign defaut recipients to the event. End-users will not see that there are default recipients.

_**Example:** imagine that you, as a developer or manufacturer would like to get notifications on certain state of the device for your own analysis, but you don't won't your customers to see these notifications._

Default recipients can only be taken from certain Metadata fields: 

* `Device Owner` metadata-  this one is available by default. No need to create this metadata.
* `Contact` metadata . Make sure email or phone number is enabled.
* `Email` metadata

#### How to set it up

For example, you need to send an email to **techncial.support@yourcompany.com** every time the temperature of device is over critical threshold.

1. In Templates -&gt; Your Template -&gt; Metadata:

   Create a new Metadata field of type `Email` or `Contact`.

   Name it "Technical Support email" and specify a default value \(which is`technical.support@yourcompany.com`\)

2. In Templates -&gt; Your Template -&gt; Events -&gt; Your Event -&gt; Notifications Tab

   Set a recipient of email notification as `Technical Support`

Now, all the notifications for this Event will go to the email specified in the metadata of Technical Support, which is **technical.support@yourcompany.com.** 

When device is deployed, if you go to Device -&gt; Metadata and change the value of Technical Support to let's say **another.email@yourcompany.com,** all notifications for this event will go to the newly added email.

### 

### Notification Limits

To control how often users get notified about specific events you can apply Notification limits.

**Limit Period**- limits the number of notifications to just one notification for a specified time period. Timer starts when first Event happened and notification sent.

_❇️ Example: if you set 1 hour as a limit, end-users will only get one notification within 1 hour after the first event was recorded. No matter how many events are generated by hardware \(or API calls\) during one hour after that, no notifications will be sent._

\*\*\*\*

**Event Counter** - notification will be sent only after a number of events was recorded. Counter starts when first event happened. After counter value was met, counter resets to zero. 

_❇️ Example: if the counter is set to 50 and device sends 100 events, the user would only get 1 notification \(every 51st event will trigger the notification\)._

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also use Limit period and Event counter together.
{% endhint %}

_❇️ Example: set Limit Period to 1 hour and Event Counter to 5._

* _When first event is recorded, the Limit Period timer starts and Event Counter starts_
* _Device sends 100 events_
* _When 6th event is logged, a notification is sent because counter value is met_
* _No more notifications are sent because 1h limit is active_
