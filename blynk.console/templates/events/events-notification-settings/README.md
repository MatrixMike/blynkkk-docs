# Notifications Settings

Notifications work on top of Events feature. Blynk platform offers a flexible way to send notifications to various recipients through supported channels:

* Emails
* Push Notifications to the user's smartphone
* SMS (additional charges apply)

{% hint style="info" %}
Only registered user can be a notification recipient
{% endhint %}

Notifications are configured in the second tab of Event - > Notifications

Start with Enabling notifications by turning on this option.

### Default recipients

Here you can assign defaut recipients to the event. End-users will not see that there are default recipients.

_**Example:** imagine that you, as a developer or manufacturer would like to get notifications on certain state of the device for your own analysis, but you don't won't your customers to see these notifications._

Default recipients can only be taken from certain Metadata fields:&#x20;

* `Device Owner` metadata-  this one is available by default. No need to create this metadata.
* `Contact` metadata . Make sure email or phone number is enabled.
* `Email` metadata

#### How to set it up

For example, you need to send an email to **techncial.support@yourcompany.com** every time the temperature of device is over critical threshold.

1.  In Templates -> Your Template -> Metadata:

    Create a new Metadata field of type `Email` or `Contact`.

    Name it "Technical Support email" and specify a default value (which is`technical.support@yourcompany.com`)
2.  In Templates -> Your Template -> Events -> Your Event -> Notifications Tab

    Set a recipient of email notification as `Technical Support`

Now, all the notifications for this Event will go to the email specified in the metadata of Technical Support, which is **technical.support@yourcompany.com.**&#x20;

When device is deployed, if you go to Device -> Metadata and change the value of Technical Support to let's say **another.email@yourcompany.com,** all notifications for this event will go to the newly added email.

###

### Notification Limits

To control how often users get notified about specific events you can apply Notification limits.

**Limit Period**- limits the number of notifications to just one notification for a specified time period. Timer starts when first Event happened and notification sent.

❇️ _Example: if you set 1 hour as a limit, end-users will only get one notification within 1 hour after the first event was recorded. No matter how many events are generated by hardware (or API calls) during one hour after that, no notifications will be sent._



**Event Counter** - notification will be sent only after a number of events was recorded. Counter starts when first event happened. After counter value was met, counter resets to zero.&#x20;

❇️ _Example: if the counter is set to 50 and device sends 100 events, the user would only get 1 notification (every 51st event will trigger the notification)._

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also use Limit period and Event counter together.
{% endhint %}

❇️ _Example: set Limit Period to 1 hour and Event Counter to 5._

* _When first event is recorded, the Limit Period timer starts and Event Counter starts_
* _Device sends 100 events_
* _When 6th event is logged, a notification is sent because counter value is met_
* _No more notifications are sent because 1h limit is active_



### Notification management

When enabled, this event will be available in for [Notification Management](../../../devices/notifications-settings.md#managing-notifications) by end-users.
