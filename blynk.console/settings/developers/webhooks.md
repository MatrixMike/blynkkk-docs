Webhooks could be found in the **Developers** section of the **Settings** menu:

![Webhooks menu item](../../../.gitbook/assets/webhook-menu.png)

![Webhooks list](../../../.gitbook/assets/webhooks.png)

If you don't see this section, this means you don't have permission to access the webhooks. Please contact your administrator for access rights.

In the view above you can find 5 specific columns:

* **Webhook name**
* **Status** – webhooks can be enabled or disabled for execution
* **Trigger event** – displays the action that causes the webhook to run
* **Last triggered** – displays last execution time in hh:mm:ss M D, Y format (the current year is hidden)
* **Attempts** – counter of all (_successful, failed, test, real action_) attempts to execute the webhook

### Actions

* **Actions Menu**
  * **Edit** – (also available from Webhook view screen)
  * **Test** – triggers test execution with success/error return from the server on the top of the screen (this execution is not saved to Webhook Log)
  * **Disable** – turns off the execution of the webhook without deleting it
  * **Delete** – opens delete modal window. Follow the steps described there&#x20;
