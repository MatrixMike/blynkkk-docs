## Roles and Permissions

![](../../.gitbook/assets/roles\_and\_perms.gif)

Blynk has 3 default roles that can have different sets of permissions:

* **Admin** – is intended to have the highest level of permissions
* **Staff** – we recommend to set up and use this role for internal company functions and client support
* **Users** – is intended to have the most limited set of permissions, mostly focused on managing their own devices

### Actions

* **Collapse/Expand all** in Actions block – applies eponymous actions to expandable permissions list
* **+ / -** buttons – click to expand/collapse specific permission sections
* **Enable/Disable** switches – use the switches to grant/prohibit certain access level and permissions to specific users types. Note that some permissions are dependent on other permissions
