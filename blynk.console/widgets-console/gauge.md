# Gauge

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**Note:**_ please remember that web and mobile app widgets are set up separately in the Web Dashboard and Mobile App Dashboard sections correspondingly. They can still use the same datastreams to access the same data (Map widget is an exception – a different codebase is used for Map on mobile and web).
{% endhint %}

A great visual way to display incoming numeric values, e.g. Temperature, Pressure, Volume, etc.

* **Title** – name the widget by editing _Gauge_ inside top field
* **Datastream** – select the one that will provide it's value
* **Level color**
  * With disabled option **Change color based on value** pick your own colour from palette
  *   With enabled **Change color based on value** select the gradient scheme or set up your own one based on the MIN and MAX values that you select.
