# LED

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**Note:**_ please remember that web and mobile app widgets are set up separately in the Web Dashboard and Mobile App Dashboard sections correspondingly. They can still use the same datastreams to access the same data (Map widget is an exception – a different codebase is used for Map on mobile and web).
{% endhint %}

This is the simplest widget that allows to visually determine brightness or color density of your device's LED.

### Settings

* Title – name your widget by editing LED in top field or leave as it is;
* Datastream – select this one that provides the corresponding values;
* Color – select a color you want from the palette.
