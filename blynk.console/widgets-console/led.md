# LED

_**Note:**_ please remember that web and apps widgets are set up separately and may have same datastreams set to view the same data (excepts Image Gallery Map widgets – those two use different codebase now).

This is the simplest widget that allows to visually determine brightness or color density of your device's LED

* Title – name your widget by editing LED in top field or leave as it is;
* Datastream – select this one that provides the corresponding values;
* Color – select a color you want from the palette.
