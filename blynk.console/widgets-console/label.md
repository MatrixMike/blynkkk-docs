# Label

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**Note:**_ please remember that web and mobile app widgets are set up separately in the Web Dashboard and Mobile App Dashboard sections correspondingly. They can still use the same datastreams to access the same data (Map widget is an exception – a different codebase is used for Map on mobile and web).
{% endhint %}

Label is used to show value of Virtual Pin e.g. length/distance, mass, duration, volume, temperature and other data types including strings. Also it can show level/progress bar (horizontal or vertical) and/or have widget colors changes based on getting different predefined values.
