# Developer Mode

**Developer** is a special user who has access to all the functionality required to configure the platform for the use by end-users (also called as clients or end-customers). This is usually someone who builds the hardware, develops the firmware, and does all the device configurations.

By default, first user in the Organization becomes a Developer.

Developer can:

* Create and configure Device Templates in Blynk.Console
* Create and configure web dashboard UI
* Create and configure mobile dashboard UI
* Add new devices to the account
* Publish Templates to Blynk.Marketplace (work in progress)
* Use other features accordingly to the chosen [plan](https://blynk.io/pricing)

## **How To Enable Developer Mode**

1. In the Blynk app or in [Blynk.Console](https://blynk.cloud)
2. Navigate to **My Profile** / **User profile** in the left menu
3. Check that **Developer Mode** switch is set to ON

### Multiple developers

Itâ€™s allowed to add multiple developers per Organization within the [PRO or Business plans](https://blynk.io/pricing). Assign a user the Admin role in your Organization so they can switch to the Developer mode.

For Free and Plus plans, if you want some other user to be a developer in your organization you should first switch off the dev mode in your account either in Blynk.Console or Blynk.App. After that the other user can switch it on.
